```lrc
[00:30.81] You know the sun has gone down
[00:38.78] And the sky is all red
[00:47.02] The earth feels the hurt
[00:54.12] And you heard just what I said
[01:09.12] 
[01:01.74] Just what I said, just what I said
[01:18.74] 
[01:09.36] Just what I said
[01:24.97] Just what I said
[01:40.49] Just what I said
[01:48.49] 
[01:57.68] And the sky is all red
[02:04.42] The earth feels the hurt
[02:11.63] And you heard just what I said
[02:26.63] 
[02:18.98] Just what I said
[02:26.98] 
[02:42.38] Just what I said
